# Odin Landing Page

This is a landing page for the Odin project.

I wanted to take this project a little further than the original design given by TOP,
I wanted to capture my passions and what I would love to create on my own, a comunity of people who enjoy the same sports.

# Main Learnings

- writing clean and concise commit messages for every major change.
- scroll based animations
